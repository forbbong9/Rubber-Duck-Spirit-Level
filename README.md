# Rubber-Duck-Spirit-Level
This is a project from my Spring 2016 semester, CS6326 Human Computer Interaction course.

###Project discription:
There are already a lot good spirit level applications already published in App Store, 
some have clean and simple interface, and some have strong functionalities 
more than only a spirit level (like a ruler). 
Thus I think, it might be difficult for me to come up with a better one, 
but I can definitely develop a much cuter one â€“ the Rubber Duck Spirit Level.
